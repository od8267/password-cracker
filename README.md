1. Download the complete package
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install rich
   ```
3. Ensure you have a wordlist file (like `rockyou.txt`)

## üíª Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python password_cracker.py
```

### Command Line Mode
```bash
# Basic usage with MD5 hash
python password_cracker.py --hash-type 1 --target e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e

# With custom wordlist and verbose output
python password_cracker.py --wordlist /path/to/wordlist.txt --verbose

# SHA-256 hash example
python password_cracker.py --hash-type 3 --target 5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8
```

### Command Line Options

- `--hash-type {1,2,3}`: Hash algorithm (1=MD5, 2=SHA-1, 3=SHA-256)
- `--target HASH`: Target hash to crack
- `--wordlist PATH`: Path to wordlist file (default: rockyou.txt)
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed progress information

## üìÅ File Structure

```
password-cracker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ password_cracker.py    # Main application (standalone)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rockyou.txt                   # Wordlist file (user-provided)
```

## üéì Educational Objectives

- Understand password hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- Learn about wordlist/dictionary attacks
- See real-time password cracking statistics
- Appreciate the importance of strong password policies
- Understand cybersecurity concepts through hands-on experience

## üîß Technical Details

### Hash Algorithms Supported

- Handles large wordlists efficiently
- Memory-efficient streaming approach
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Security Features
- Built-in legal disclaimers
- Responsible use enforcement
- Educational context framing
- No network communication
- Local file processing only

## üîç Example Hashes for Testing

Here are some common passwords and their hashes for educational testing:

### MD5 Hashes (32 characters):
- `123456`: `e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e`
- `password`: `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8`
- `admin`: `21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3`

### SHA-1 Hashes (40 characters):
- `123456`: `7c4a8d09ca3762af61e59520943dc26494f8941b`
- `password`: `5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8`
- `admin`: `d033e22ae348aeb5660fc2140aec35850c4da997`

### SHA-256 Hashes (64 characters):
- `123456`: `8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92`
- `password`: `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8`
- `admin`: `8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918`

## üîó Wordlist Sources

For educational purposes, you can use various wordlist sources:

- **RockYou.txt**: Classic password list from the RockYou breach
- **SecLists**: Comprehensive collection of security-related lists
- **Custom Lists**: Create your own based on specific scenarios

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"rich library not found"**
   - Solution: `pip install rich` or use basic mode

2. **"Wordlist file not found"**
   - Solution: Ensure rockyou.txt is in the same directory or specify correct path

3. **"Invalid hash format"**
   - Solution: Ensure hash is hexadecimal and proper length

4. **Permission denied**
   - Solution: Check file permissions on wordlist
